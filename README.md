# Math Center and Science Center Sign Ins
## Tiffany Jansen
In the Math Center (Updated) folder there is the Math Center project, and in the Science Center folder there is the Science Center project. These projects are currently being used on campus at Western Oregon University. The professor in charge of the Math Center is obsessed with the Excel download. I tailored these sites not only to the students who sign in, but also to the faculty members who have to use it every year. The original site had a lot of extra buttons that the person in charge didn't use and didn't really want, so I removed them in one project, but left them in the other since the other faculty member in charge liked to have all the extra information. It was also very difficult to get all of the data with the old site, so I created a way to have everything on one sheet. My first draft (the one that was implemented in Spring 2019) included the excel stuff, the new and improved draft (to be implemented for Fall 2019) will also include a single page for selecting a class for students and allow students to sign into more than one class. The faculty members in charge of the site are very excited to see where this is going to go and I am so grateful that they allowed me to build them for them.
